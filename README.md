# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Correctly interpreting user needs starts with strong listening and critical thinking skills.  By engaging in a personal meeting with users, program requirements can be formed into a value statement.  “As a <role>, I want <a feature>, so that I can <accomplish something >”.  We then further detail a requirement into what is known as a user story.  User stories are natural language descriptions of the features of a system told from the user's point of view.  We expand upon the value statement with acceptance criteria, which are a set of specific requirements that must be met in order for a user story to be accepted as complete.  This information guides our initial understanding of how to begin the implementation of programs.
